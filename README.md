# AlgorithmLab 🚀
AlgorithmLab is a C# sandbox for learning algorithms through hands-on implementation, with a strong focus on performance and time comparisons. It includes a clean Algorithms library, an xUnit test project to validate correctness, and an optional Playground console app to benchmark algorithms, compare execution times, and experiment with different inputs.
